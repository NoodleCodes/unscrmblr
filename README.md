# unscrmblr
Welcome, this is my first python project ive attempted in python!
I've used Python 3.11 along with the NLKT (Natural Language Toolkit) 

Simply put the code fuctions as such:
Users are asked to input letters they would like to unscramble 
As well as one key letter they would like all the words to have in common
Nlkt then pulls from the Brown Corpus (a general language corpus containing around 1 million words)
The corupus is then tokenized and stripped into words for faster processing time
Input is set against the tokenized and stripped corpus
Then a list of possible words is returned

Thanks for visting, i've only been learning python for a few weeks so any feedback and collaberation is appreciated and encouraged!
